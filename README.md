## SketchKit

A project to develop a parametric sketching tool using React.

The user should be able to :
- Sketch basic geometric shapes (lines, boxes, circles, arcs)
- Add relations between existing elements (parallel, perpendicular, tangent...)
- Dimension each element and take measurements
- Zoom in and zoom out
- More stuff as I think of it
